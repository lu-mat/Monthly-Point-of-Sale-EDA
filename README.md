# Monthly-Point-of-Sale-EDA
EDA for monthly point of sale analysis. Goal is to use this for time-series predictions

Every month we collect data on point of sale units from each major retailer. These units are recorded on a weekly basis and put into a master excel document with a sheet for each retailer. 
We have recorded unit sale for each week of 2019-2020. 

end goal is to do time-series predictive analysis based on sales history to determine purchase orders 3 months into the future.
